"Corruption, crime and conflict in eastern Ukraine  
6 Summary  
Conflict in eastern Ukraine has been underway since 2014: the February 2014 ouster of 
pro-Russia President Yanukovych was followed in March by Russian annexation of 
Crimea, and its support for insurgency in the Donetz Basin (Donbas) – the latter is 
ongoing . This paper is a rapid literature review of the links between corruption, crime 
and conflict in eastern Ukraine. While Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea was rooted 
both in Moscow’s historic claims to the peninsula, as well as moves by Kiev to move 
closer  to the European Union, the ongoing insurgency in the Donetz Basin (Donbas) 
stems from structural factors such as industrial decline. Russian support for the Donbas 
insurgents, alongside  its failure to recognise the republics that they announced (Donetsk 
People’s Republic and Luhansk People’s Republic), suggests that Moscow’s real goal is to 
put pressure on the Ukrainian government and prevent its integration into Western 
structures.  
The paper assesses the impact of the conflict on the economy of Crimea an d Donbas. 
Russia has tried to demonstrate the benefits to Crimea of annexation by pumping vast 
resources into the region, but this resource injection has been unable to overcome the 
effects of wide -ranging Western sanctions. Donbas’ economy has been even m ore badly 
affected by ongoing conflict, with thousands displaced and an economic blockade"|input/report2.pdf|5|cb513bcfca3f4ff096456a5043047ef0
"affected by ongoing conflict, with thousands displaced and an economic blockade 
imposed by Kiev greatly limiting trade. Here too, Moscow has had to step in with 
subsidies and humanitarian assistance.  
The paper also looks at the involvement of or ganised criminal groups (OCGs) in the 
conflict, and the impact of the conflict on organised crime in the region. With regard to 
the former it finds that OCGs played a big role in Russia’s annexation of Crimea, fighting 
alongside Russian forces (without the ir insignia) and other volunteers. This highlights 
the complementary and symbiotic nature of the connection between criminal groups 
and the Russian state. OCGs in the Donbas region had strong links with the Yanukovych 
government in Ukraine, ousted in 2014 – hence it is no surprise that these groups were 
heavily involved in the Donbas insurgency.  
With regard to how organised crime has been affected by conflict, the paper finds that 
corruption was a massive problem in Ukraine long before the conflict in the e ast. 
Moreover, it involved all  levels of the government system  and was strongly linked to 
organised crime. OCGs were especially prevalent in Crimea, while Donbas was even 
more notorious for criminality. Post -Crimea’s annexation, links between OCGs in Crime a 
and in Russia became even stronger. Ironically, due to the vast influx of Russian 
development funds, Crimea represented an opportunity for embezzlement and"|input/report2.pdf|5|315179d71d24469b848503a1fc8e2639
"development funds, Crimea represented an opportunity for embezzlement and 
corruption for Russian and Crimean OCGs. Closer ties were even forged between 
Russian OCGs and tho se in Ukraine. Since the conflict in Donbas began – and given the 
economic blockade, and falling Russian funding support - the region has become heavily 
dependent on organised crime.  
The paper also finds that oligarchs, with close ties to organised crime,  have benefited 
hugely from Crimea becoming part of Russia, e.g. seizing property belonging to pro -"|input/report2.pdf|5|30e1bbd60da640c89b8397b2a56c5d18

7 Ukraine business elites. Ties with political elites are equally strong: gangs gain 
protection from political patronage, in turn giving kickbacks to politicia ns. 
One final aspect explored in the paper is transnational crime. It finds that this has risen 
since the annexation of Crimea and conflict in Donbas, including a rise in smuggling of 
illicit goods into Europe, and a rise in organised crime in Ukraine. Sev astopol could 
potentially take over as a smuggling hub from Odesa, while Crimea and Ukraine could 
become a global money laundering centre. Criminality in Russia has also increased, seen 
in rises in drug and arms trafficking and criminal cases. The drop in cross -border 
cooperation to combat crime has contributed to greater criminality.     
The paper concludes that corruption, crime and conflict are heavily intermeshed in 
eastern Ukraine, with each reinforcing the other in what appears to be a downward 
spiral  of escalation."|input/report2.pdf|6|9ec254020ea8474db8ec8ce943a0a8e2

8 1. Introduction  
This short evidence review looks at the links between corruption, crime and conflict in 
eastern Ukraine . As well as explaining the background to the current conflict in eastern 
Ukraine, the report looks at the pre -conflict si tuation with regard to organised crime 
and corruption. It then examines how organised crime and corruption play a role 
in/have been impacted by the conflict. In particular it explores the role of organised 
crime actors in t he Russian annexation of Crimea  and in the Donbas separatist 
movement. The conflict has created new opportunities for criminality and corruption, 
and these are examined, along with the impact on transnational crime.    
This report draws entirely on desk -based research  of open source mater ial. It is a rapid 
review with key search words including ‘Ukraine’, ‘eastern Ukraine’, ‘Crimea’, ‘Donbas’, 
‘serious organised crime’, ‘corruption’, ‘oligarchs’, ‘transnational crime’, ‘Russia’, 
‘organised criminal groups’, ‘insurgency’ and ‘conflict’. Whi le the literature reviewed 
was a mixture o f academic and grey literature, preference has been given to open access 
sources for accessibility to a wide range of potential readers."|input/report2.pdf|7|60d13177ddd94ffc9863dacf87e0abc2
"Corruption, crime and conflict in eastern Ukraine  
9 2. Background  
Since gaining independence, Ukraine has been marked by deep inte rnal divisions 
between the largely Ukrainian -speaking population in the western part of the country, 
who favour closer ties with Europe, and the Russian -speaking population in the eastern 
part, who favour closer ties with Russia. Ukraine’s east -west split has deep historic 
roots: the south and east of the country were part of the former Russian empire, while 
the western provinces were part of the Austrian Hapsburg empire (Darden, 2014).  
2.1. Crimea  
The crisis in Ukraine began in November 2013 with protests in K iev at President 
Yanukovych’s decision to reject a deal for greater economic integration with the 
European Union. The authorities responded with a security crackdown, which drew 
even more protestors onto the streets, and led to Yanukovych fleeing the count ry in 
February 2014. In March 2014, following the successor Ukrainian government’s 
announcement that it intended to sign an association agreement with the European 
Union, Russian special forces annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea. They were 
aided by the fact that the Ukrainian military – many of them Russian -speaking – 
remained in their garrisons; Kiev could not rely on their loyalty to combat the Russians 
(Pifer, 2020). ‘Regional authorities there organized a hasty and illegitimate referendum"|input/report2.pdf|8|bc10b57df6724dccb6e0139c63f9221e
"(Pifer, 2020). ‘Regional authorities there organized a hasty and illegitimate referendum 
to join  Russia, and in March 2014, Russia formally annexed Crimea – a move that most of 
the world denounced’ (Pifer, 2019). As well as concerns about Ukraine as a whole falling 
into the West’s ambit, Moscow had specific interests in Crimea. Russian naval forces a re 
based in the Black Sea (Masters, 2020) and the prospect of NATO having a presence 
there (which could have followed closer ties with the West) was something the Kremlin 
was not prepared to countenance (Pifer, 2020).  
Moscow also lays historic claims to Crimea. Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev transferred 
Crimea from Russia to Ukraine in 1954 in order to strengthen ‘brotherly ties between 
the Ukrainian and Russian peoples’ (Masters, 2020). However, since the collapse of the 
Soviet Union, many Russian natio nalists in both Russia and Crimea have longed for the 
peninsula to go back to Russia (Masters, 2020). Putin framed the Euromaidan protests 
and Yanukovych’s ouster from power as a ‘Western -backed “fascist coup” that 
endangered the ethnic Russian majority in  Crimea’ (Masters, 2020). Russia’s seizure of 
the peninsula was justified as ‘a rescue operation’ ( Masters, 2020 ). 
Having annexed Crimea, Russia has been trying to demonstrate the benefits for the 
region of joining the Russian Federation. ‘Trying to create  a success story, Moscow has"|input/report2.pdf|8|954bd35d95ea4470aabb81eff9c506ad
"region of joining the Russian Federation. ‘Trying to create  a success story, Moscow has 
poured in more than USD 10 billion in direct subsidies as well as funding major 
construction and infrastructure projects, such as the highway and railway bridges that 
now cross the Kerch Strait to link Crimea directly to Russia ’ (Pifer, 2020). However, 
small businesses have suffered, in particular because of the drop in tourism which used 
to account for about 25% of Crimea’s economy (Pifer, 2020). In addition, Crimea has 
been targeted by a range of Western economic and other san ctions. Pifer (2020)"|input/report2.pdf|8|9848c8d272d34f278d4f23b1b225b966
"Corruption, crime and conflict in eastern Ukraine  
10 concludes: ‘It is probably fair to say that the reality of the economic situation today falls 
short of what many in Crimea expected, or hoped for, with Russia’s annexation’.  
2.2. Donbas  
In April 2014, just a month after the Russian annexat ion of Crimea, fighting broke out in 
the Donbas (short for Donets Basin), a region in eastern Ukraine bordering Russia. 
There were significant structural factors driving the insurgency:  
For decades this corner of south -eastern Ukraine has struggled with a 
decaying industrial economy, out -migration and a growing sense of 
frustration among the population…. Donbas was  responsible for roughly one 
quarter of Ukraine’s industrial production in the decades  before the war. But 
its people had precious little to show for it. Wage arrears were the  worst in 
the country, life expectancies were low, carbon emissions were through the  
roof and – thanks in part to lagging birth rates and high infant mortality – the 
population  was agein g (ICG, 2020: i).  
Separatists (composed of locals but with significant Russian backing – leadership, 
funding, weapons, ammunition, and even some regular Russian military units) seized 
large swathes of territory in the oblasts (provinces) of Donetsk and Luhansk (Pifer, 
2019). They announced the f ormation of the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) and the 
Luhansk People’s Republic (LPR). However, unlike in Crimea, in the Donbas Ukrainian"|input/report2.pdf|9|c2fbf11c6b8e4224895b4a2675799886
"Luhansk People’s Republic (LPR). However, unlike in Crimea, in the Donbas Ukrainian 
forces did fight back, and by August 2014 had retaken most of the region from the 
separatists. At this point, the Ru ssian army had to intervene directly to prevent defeat. 
Moscow provided ‘extensive material backing for the fighters, including training, unit 
leadership, fuel, ammuniti on, armour and other weaponry (armoured personnel 
carriers , artillery, rocket launchers , and air defence systems) (Jensen, 2017: 4).  
Moscow justifies its actions in the region on the grounds that there are around eight 
million ethnic Russians in Ukraine who need protection (Masters, 2020). A further 
factor, on top of Russian concerns about the ouster of Yanukovych and Ukraine’s moves 
towards the EU, was Putin’s desire to bolster his support at home (Masters, 2020). The 
Russian intervention in Ukraine led to Putin’s approval ratings rising to over 80% (they 
had been in steady decline prior to  this) (Masters, 2020).  
There has been conflict in the Donbas region since then, with over 14,000 people killed 
(Boulegue & Lutsevuch, 2020: 4). France and Germany were involved in various efforts 
at securing ceasefires (Minsk Agreements) but none of thes e held. The most fierce 
battles were fought in 2014 -15, but in recent years a form of stalemate has been 
reached: around one -third of the Donbas, centring on the industrial cities of Donetsk and"|input/report2.pdf|9|f35d5609eca54a70b7a4ad116ac9343e

a trench war, with roughly 75,000 troops facing off along a 420 km -long frontline cutting 
through densely populated area s’ (ICG, 2021).  Mila kovsky (2019) claims that the

"Corruption, crime and conflict in eastern Ukraine  
12 Despite its extensive support for the insurgency, Russia has not recognised the DPR and 
LPR and they remain ‘pseudo -states’, collectively referred to as Certain Areas of Donetsk 
and Luhansk Regions (CADLR) or Non -Government Controlled Areas (NGCAs). Jensen 
(2017: 2) argues that President Putin is using the conflict in eastern Ukraine to put 
pressure on the Ukrainian government:  ‘At its core the war in Ukra ine is not a civil war 
or the result of a popular uprising….It is a conflict manufactured by Moscow to achieve a 
strategic foreign policy goal: preventing Ukraine’s integration into Western security, 
political and economic structures’.  Boulegue and Lutsevy ch (2020: 2) echo this, arguing 
that the Kremlin seeks ‘to promote polarization and encourage a clash between 
Ukraine’s citizens and its governing elite by taking military action, manipulating the 
corruption narrative, supporting pro -Russia parties and fue lling religious tensions 
through the Russian Orthodox Church’.  
2.3. Economic impact of Donbas conflict  
The conflict has taken a massive toll on the Donbas region’s economy and heavy 
industries. Millions of people have been forced to relocate, and the conflict z one has 
become one of the world’s most mine -contaminated areas.  In 2017, follow ing a move by 
separatists to nationalise factories and mines in areas under their control, the Ukrainian"|input/report2.pdf|11|5eec6f7598b6476d9d51975af175d4e5
"separatists to nationalise factories and mines in areas under their control, the Ukrainian 
government imposed an economic blockade (Milakovsky , 2019; ICG, 2020). Trade 
across government and separatist -held areas fell even further. Trade with Russia was 
also difficult:  
Moscow has not recognised the de facto  statelets’ independence, making it 
illegal for Russian firms to engage in commerce  with b usinesses located 
there. Businesses in the breakaway regions are thus in a situation  where they 
cannot trade with entities in either Russia to the east or government -
controlled  Ukraine to the west (ICG, 2020: ii).  
Some have found ways to do so, but ‘these  improvised arrangements are often 
inefficient, illegal or both’ (ICG, 2020: ii). One of the main ways is to move goods to 
Russia and then re -export them from there, e.g. coal from the Donbas is mixed with 
Russian coal, and it is all marketed as Russian. B ut Russia’s economy can absorb or 
launder for re -export only a portion of what the region produces. Lack of access to 
global markets via Ukraine is causing many once functioning mines to flood and 
factories to rust: a tipping point will be reached when it will no longer be possible to 
revive these economic assets. The International Crisis Group ( ICG, 2020: i) concludes:

13 pensions (approximately USD 40 million alone for DPR), other social programmes, 
government and military  salaries (Jensen, 2017: 3).  
Excluding military expenditures, Russia spends roughly USD1.5 -2 billion a 
year, or about 0.1 percent of its GDP, on the de facto republics, according to 
Ukrainian government sources and non -government experts. As of 2017, 
Ukrai nian officials estimated that Moscow was covering about 50 percent of 
the DPR’s budget and about 80 percent of the LPR’s. Russia also has covered 
all the LPR’s energy needs since 2017….. Both statelets get their gas from 
Russia’s Gazprom, which keeps house hold energy costs low relative to those 
in government -controlled Ukraine  (ICG, 2020: 20).  
Fischer (2019: 29) notes that Russia’s role as a provider of humanitarian aid for the 
NGCAs has grown: dozens of convoys with over 77,000 tons of humanitarian aid hav e 
been sent by the Russian Ministry of Emergency Situations. The Russian public also give 
donations, and between 2014 and 2015 Russia took in almost one million war refugees 
from Ukraine (Fischer, 2019: 29).  Thousands of older residents subsist by maintain ing 
an address in  government -controlled territory, which allows them to continue  receiving 
their government pensions so long as they travel over the front line – through a war 
zone – to collect them  (ICG, 2020: ii) ."|input/report2.pdf|12|d45d933550cf4d319b2841487188e4be

14 3. Pre-conflict situation re garding  
organised crime and corruption  
3.1. Ukraine  
Corruption has been a growing problem in Ukraine since the country gained 
independence. The Corruption Perception Index 2020 ranked Ukraine 117 out of 180 
countries for corruption with a score of 33/100, with 0 being  highly corrupt and 100 
meaning very clean.1 A study (EUACI, 2020) found that, for the population, corruption 
was the second most important social problem after the hostilities in Donbas: 69% of 
citizens indicated corruption among the very serious problems  of Ukraine, while 72.7% 
held this view of military action in eastern Ukraine. The World Justice Project’s Rule of 
Law Index ranked Ukraine 72nd out of 128 countries overall in 2020, but 110th in the 
category ‘absence of corruption’ and 90th in ‘criminal j ustice’ (Lough, 2021: 5).  
Corruption is pervasive in Ukraine. A Ukrai nian government diagnostic study of high -
level corruption, prepared with the assistance of the IMF in 2014, noted the ‘pyramidal’ 
nature of state capture permeating the government system,  featuring ‘powerful well -
known elites at the top, heads of agencies in the middle and agency staff at the base’  
(Ash et al, 2017: 76). Government corruption has led to knock -on effects in society. The 
ICG (2017) estimated that between one quarter and half  of the population operated in"|input/report2.pdf|13|4400b4a6ea194a73bcda3a4c0a659ecb
"ICG (2017) estimated that between one quarter and half  of the population operated in 
the shadow economy. The ICG (2017)  found that corruption had resulted in ‘ a dramatic 
weakening of the state: millions of dollars bypassing the official budget, chronic low -
level violence in centres of illegal trade, and swath es of rural territory with no legal 
workforce or tax base to speak of ’. Ash et al (2017: 76) note that, ‘ Corruption on a grand 
scale has not only cost the country’s citizens dearly over more than 20 years, but has 
cemented in place a system that is impossi ble to dislodge without deep changes to the 
operating environment ’.  
Corruption in Ukraine is strongly linked to organised crime. Ash et al (2017: 77) write: 
‘It is clear that the fusion of money and power since independence in 1991 transformed 
the role of  Ukraine’s law enforcement institutions, so that their original task of 
protecting the Soviet system from within became one of supporting criminal activity by 
the new economic and political elites. Organized crime became synonymous with the 
functioning of the state ’. 
With regard to types of organised crime, the literature refers to, among others, 
trafficking in drugs, arms and persons; prostitution; illegal amber mining; cybercrime 
and fraud. Ukraine is a hub for transnational organised crime, in particular  drugs and 
arms trafficking, as well as money laundering. The International Narcotics Control"|input/report2.pdf|13|26e4ad12374c454ca4a8547f3f91e471

15 Although Ukraine is not a major drug source country, its location astride 
several important drug trafficking routes into Western Europe leaves it 
vulnerable as an important transit country. Ukraine’s numerous ports on the 
Black and Azov seas, its extensive river routes, and its porous northern and 
eastern borders make Ukraine an at tractive route for drug traffickers into the 
European Union’s (EU) illicit drug market. Heroin from Afghanistan is 
trafficked through Russia, the Caucasus, and Turkey, before passing through 
Ukraine. Latin American cocaine is moved through Ukrainian seapor ts and 
airports for both domestic use and further transit to EU countries. Ukrainian 
law enforcement occasionally interdicts large shipments of drugs in 
commercial shipments transiting southern ports.  
The same report describes money laundering in Ukraine a s follows (USSD BINLEA, 
2019, cited in Home Office, 2019: 14):  
Money is laundered through real estate, insurance, financial and non -
financial institutions, shell companies, and bulk cash smuggling schemes. 
Criminals use aliases to register as [ultimate be neficial owners] UBOs  of 
companies to comingle licit and illicit funds. Transnational organized crime 
syndicates use Ukraine as a transit country for money and drugs.

emerged in the 2000s, when a rise in the global price of amber stimulated illicit mining 
(ICG, 2017: 4). The ouster of President Yanukovych in 2014, and the onset of instability 
and conflict led to economic recession, which drove many peop le to turn to illicit mining. 
This in turn led to increased chaos as ‘rival bands vying for turf filled the vacuum left by 
the consolidated protection racket that disintegrated after Yanukovych fled’ (Radio 
Europe, cited in Home Office, 2019: 20). As of 20 17 Ukraine’s amber business was 
thought to be worth as much as USD 500 million each year ( Home Office, 2019: 20 ). 
3.2. Crimea  
The break -up of the Soviet Union paved the way for entrenched corruption and 
organised crime in Ukraine, but the Crimea in general and the port of Simferopol had, 
even before the collapse of the USSR, ‘become free -wheeling havens for smuggling, black 
marke teering and a lucrative array of embezzlement schemes centering on the region’s 
health spas and holiday resorts’ (Galeotti, 2014b). Post -independence, organised crime"|input/report2.pdf|14|4bf3776b50e74d62b2eaf01d25029459
"health spas and holiday resorts’ (Galeotti, 2014b). Post -independence, organised crime 
in Crimea assumed an increasingly visible and violent form: Simferopol was fought over 
by two rival gangs (the Bashmaki and the Salem), who were at once entrepreneurs and 
predators who forced local businesses to pay tribute and sell their goods ( Galeotti, 
2014b ). Galeotti (2014b) asserts that by the 2000s these gangsters -turned -businessmen 
wer e increasingly dominant within Crimea, facilitated by the fact that Kiev showed little 
interest in promoting good governance and economic prosperity in the region – ‘this"|input/report2.pdf|14|d0e9b4ce2af64343905bbd4a60974cdb
"Corruption, crime and conflict in eastern Ukraine  
16 gave local elites both free reign and also a perverse legitimacy’. The key commoditie s 
targeted by organised criminals were control of businesses and of land, e.g. Bashmaki 
leaders tried to take over Crimea’s main soccer club, SC Tavria Simferopol, largely for 
the properties it owned (Galeotti, 2014b).  
Two further aspects are noteworthy: one, organised criminals in the Crimea moved into 
both above -board businesses, and local government and politics. A former prosecutor 
in the region recalled that ‘every government level of Crimea was criminalized’ 
(Viktor  Shemchuk, cited in Galeotti, 2014b ). Two, the Russian connection to 
criminalisation in  Crimea:  
Although Crimea was part of Ukraine, many of the most lucrative criminal 
businesses, such as trafficking narcotics and counterfeit or untaxed 
cigarettes, depended on relationships with the Russia n criminal 
networks. ….likewise the peninsula's dirty money was typically laundered 
through Russian banks and in the process became all but untraceable for the 
Ukrainian  police (Galeotti, 2014b).  
These links between Crimean OCGs and Russia would prove very significant when 
Yanukovych fled Ukraine and Moscow decided to annex Crimea.  
3.3. Donbas  
The Donbas, and specifically Donetsk province, was even more notorious for criminality 
than Crimea. Kosicki and Nesterenko (2014) note that ‘”rule of law” as such was a my th in"|input/report2.pdf|15|d10508bfc60840d49da6cffcf7774601
"than Crimea. Kosicki and Nesterenko (2014) note that ‘”rule of law” as such was a my th in 
the Donbas even before the Soviet collapse’. They liken it to a ‘mafia state’, controlled by 
neither Kiev nor Moscow, and in which organised crime dominated the cultural and social 
life of the region. One historical factor was that the former Soviet Union had built lots of 
penal colonies in Donetsk, and released prisoners remained there becoming ‘fodder for an 
emerging criminal industry based in late -night entertainment, gambling and trafficking’ 
(Kosicki & Nesterenko, 2014). Moreover, the traits and norms practised in prisons and 
labour colonies (e.g. acceptance of territoriality, rackets, tattoos) shaped not only social 
and economic life, but also Donbas civic and legal cultures. ‘Indeed, in many sectors of 
Donbas life, legal nihilism became prevalen t’ (Kosicki & Nesterenko,  2014).  
In the first decade following Ukraine’s independence, the Donbas had the highest level of 
criminal activity in the country: in 1991 alone, the Donetsk police department recorded 
2,186 criminal groups responsible for over 4 ,000 alleged crimes, and the number of OCGs 
has grown steadily since 1991, while total crime in the Donetsk region increased by 50 
percent between 1991 and 1993 (Kosicki & Nesterenko, 2014). Over the next decade 
Donetsk continued to top tables for register ed crimes and homicides across Ukraine;"|input/report2.pdf|15|2a1835edfe2d4227b69bc83926af4778
"Donetsk continued to top tables for register ed crimes and homicides across Ukraine; 
reflected in the province also having the highest number of prisons (20) in Ukraine 
followed by Luhansk with 16 (Kosicki & Nesterenko, 2014). As the coal industry in the 
Donbas declined – in 2013 alone, 30,000 people  were laid off – gangs and organised crime 
became the way to ensure survival and success (Kosicki & Nesterenko,  2014).  
Even before the 2014 insurgency, OCGs were ‘selling’ their capacity to carry out 
violence, notably to political groups. This ‘violent ent repreneurship’ was seen in the"|input/report2.pdf|15|9c859e4c54724c6895a2c756a3086ef3

17 titushki  or thugs hired to harass political rivals and break up their rallies. This 
phenomenon was increasingly common in 2013 and was especially deployed by 
Yanukovych’s Party of the Regions, whose base was in the Donbas. In  sum, there were 
already strong links between criminal gangs and political elites in the Donbas.  
3.4. Anti -corruption measures  
Efforts have been made to combat corruption. The Euromaidan protests at the end of 
2013 started as an attempt to force President Yan ukovych to sign an association 
agreement with the EU, but quickly transformed into anti -government protests focused 
on corruption:   
Ukrainians took to the streets to denounce the country’s endemic corruption, 
from the  grand corruption  practiced by ex -pres ident Yanukovych  and his 
peers, to everyday corruption and petty unfairness —like the need to bribe a 
teacher to get better classroom conditions for your children, a doctor to get 
an appointment, or the traffic police to avoid unlawful fines  (OSF, 2019).  
While the protests led to Yanukovych fleeing the country, three years on, the 
Euromaidan movement’s demands that the authorities curb corruption and put high -
level corrupt officials behinds bars, remained unfulfilled:  
There have been no convictions of senio r officials from the administration of 
former president Viktor Yanukovych, despite overwhelming evidence that"|input/report2.pdf|16|e333d97d516a405985444d3ea270ac7a
"former president Viktor Yanukovych, despite overwhelming evidence that 
many oversaw the theft of public assets on an epic scale…With the notable 
exception of Naftogaz, state -owned enterprises (SOEs) continue to bleed the 
equivalent of billions of dollars annually from the state budget through 
corrupt schemes (Ash et al, 2017: 75).  
The post -Yanukovych government of President Poroshenko established a number of anti -
corruption bodies, including the National Agency for Prevention of Corruption (NAPC), the 
National Anti -Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU), the Specialized Anti -Corruption 
Prosecutor’s Office (SAPO), the State Bureau of Investigation (SBI) and the Asset 
Management and Recovery Office (AMRO) (Ash et al, 2017 : 83; Home Office, 2019: 22). 
There have been some reform successes: elimination of gas sales from Russia (previously 
the largest source of corruption in the economy), which has shrunk the space in which 
corrupt practices can occur; improved public sector transparency through the 
introduction of an electronic system for state procurement tenders; and an e -declaration 
system through which senior officials must declare their assets (Ash et al, 2017: viii).  
However, the new anti -corruption bodies have come und er strong political pressure from 
elites and oligarchs opposed to reform. ‘Since the inception of the anticorruption 
infrastructure, various political actors attempted to embed loyal agents in the institutions"|input/report2.pdf|16|331543ffb67742508c564853be17b61e
"infrastructure, various political actors attempted to embed loyal agents in the institutions 
through legislative changes and political leve rage over selection procedures or to dissolve 
them altogether’ (US State Dept., 2020: 42). As a result legislation providing criminal 
penalties for corruption has not been effectively implemented and ‘many officials engaged 
in corrupt practices with impuni ty….corruption remained pervasive at all levels in the 
executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government’ (US State Dept., 2020)."|input/report2.pdf|16|f39e5cc5555c4915b96653a792b9fb39

18 4. Links between organised crime 
and conflict  
4.1. Crimea  
Organised criminal groups played a major role in Russia’s annexation of Crimea. They 
were one of three types of forces used: one being Russian commandoes and marines 
fighting without their insignia (Moscow denied official involvement in Crimea); the 
second local police; and the third ‘self -defence forces’. Of the  latter, some were veterans 
and volunteers, but ‘many  were the foot soldiers of the peninsula's crime gangs, 
including Bashmaki and the descendants of Salem, who had temporarily put their 
rivalries aside to pull Crimea out of Ukraine ’ (Galeotti, 2014b) . Although key missions 
were undertaken by Russian so -called ‘little green men’ (special forces without their 
insignia), the local militias (gangsters) played a significant role in seizing government 
buildings and cordoning off Ukrainian garrisons.   
Crime, esp ecially organized crime, has been at the heart of the events in 
Ukraine from the start. Many of the burly and well -armed ""self -defence 
volunteers"" who came out on the streets  alongside the not -officially -Russian 
troops turned out to be local gangsters, and  the governing elite there have 
close, long -term relations with organized crime (Galeotti, 2014a).   
A local prosecutor explains why organised criminal groups got involved: ‘T hey knew it"|input/report2.pdf|17|f5c0dc066ad94920bfeec828c5787e8a
"A local prosecutor explains why organised criminal groups got involved: ‘T hey knew it 
would be good for them both  [Bashmaki and Salem ] and there were powerf ul people in 
Moscow who asked them to do it ’ (cited in Galeotti, 2014b). Sergei Aksyonov, the ‘Head 
of the Republic of Crimea’ ( de facto prime minister ) since 2014 was a member of the 
Salem organised criminal group in the 1990s, going by the nickname ‘Gobl in’ (Galeotti, 
2014b). Galeotti (2014b) comments:  
what the Crimean annexation has demonstrated in especially stark form is 
the connection between crime and the Russian state that is not essentially 
parasitic and competitive (as it is when criminals embezzl e the federal 
budget) but instead complementary and symbiotic. Indeed, Crimea is a case 
study both of the way that the Kremlin uses criminals as instruments of state 
policy and also how the underworld and upperworld have become 
inextricably entwined as a c onsequence.  
Alongside links between organised criminal groups in Crimea and Russian political 
elites, links between OCGs in Crimea and those in Russia also rapidly strengthened 
following the annexation of the region. These were strong even before 2014. ’Al though 
Crimea was part of Ukraine, many of the most lucrative criminal businesses, such as 
trafficking narcotics and counterfeit or untaxed cigarettes, depended on relationships 
with the Russian criminal networks’ (Galeotti, 2014b)."|input/report2.pdf|17|df4c582d23a74c1eba63d1fb205479fa
"Corruption, crime and conflict in eastern Ukraine  
19 After Crimea’s annexat ion Galeotti (2014a) describes how ‘the big Moscow -based crime 
networks (were) sending their smotryashchye  – the term means a local overseer, but 
now also means, in effect, an ambassador – there to connect with local gangs’. For 
Russian OCGs, the Crimea re presented opportunities: one, for fraud and embezzlement 
of the massive inflow of development funds from Moscow, to support the Kremlin’s goal 
of making the region a symbol of the benefits of joining the Russian federation; and two, 
to use Black Sea smuggl ing routes and turn the port of Simferopol into a big smuggling 
hub in place of Odessa in Ukraine. Early investment by Moscow in Crimea amounted to 
USD 4.5 billion, meaning there ‘was ample scope for kickbacks, sweetheart deals, and 
simple attrition of con struction materials’ (Galeotti, 2014b). Embezzlement, corruption 
and smuggling in and through Crimea were forecast to be a big business. Indeed, 
preliminary Interior Ministry figures for the first three months of Russian control 
show ed that smuggling, economic crime, and violent offen ces rose by between 5 and 9 
percent  (Galeotti 2014b) . 
A further, more surprising, type of links forged in the wake of Russia’s annexation of 
Crimea was between Ukrainian OCGs and those in Russia/Crimea. Gal eotti (2014b) 
noted that it appeared as if ‘Ukraine’s gangsters are perversely stepping up their"|input/report2.pdf|18|4f04148882e5417a9d529cdb1eb8e856
"noted that it appeared as if ‘Ukraine’s gangsters are perversely stepping up their 
cooperation with their Russian counterparts even while Kiev fights a Moscow -based 
insurgency’.  
4.2. Donbas  
As seen, separatist movements in the Donbas emerged quic kly in the wake of Russia’s 
annexation of Crimea. Neglect of the region by successive Ukrainian governments 
contributed to the sense of frustration felt by local people, and thus to the insurgency 
(ICG, 2020). One could argue that wide -scale corruption in Ukraine and strong links to 
organised crime contributed to weak governance which contributed to conflict drivers 
in Luhansk and Donetsk.  
Kosicki and Nesterenko (2014) highlight a further factor: many of Ukraine’s political and 
economic leaders came from t he Donbas – Yanukovych, his predecessor President Leonid 
Kuchma, businessman Rinat Akhmetov (Ukraine’s richest man at one point) and others. 
Billions of dollars of assets belonging to these men were tied to Yanukovych’s Party of 
Regions as well as to Russi a (Darden, 2014). The Euromaidan protests, and the ouster of 
Yanukovych, brought about a massive regional shift in power. From the Yanukovych 
government with 75 percent of ministerial level leadership from the south and east of the 
country, and 42 percent from Donetsk, the new government under Prime Minister 
Yatsenyuk had only two ministers from the south and east – all others came from the west"|input/report2.pdf|18|3309864b84374ae7a3969840baa6be66
"Yatsenyuk had only two ministers from the south and east – all others came from the west 
of the country (Darden, 2014). The regime change thus represented a massive threat to 
the ‘stakeholders in the Do nbas mafia state’ (Kosicki & Nesterenko, 2014).   
It is therefore not surprising that OCGs played a direct role in the insurgency. In the 
same way as happened in Crimea, when conflict broke out in Donetsk and Luhansk, 
members of OCGs were among those fight ing against the Ukrainian government. 
‘Likewise, in eastern Ukraine, criminals have been sworn in as members of local militias 
and even risen to senior ranks, while the police, long known for their corruption, are 
fighting alongside them’ (Galeotti, 2014b) . The insurgents – comprised of local fighters,"|input/report2.pdf|18|5bca734232a342ffaa501eaeb61f72cc
"Corruption, crime and conflict in eastern Ukraine  
20 members of OCGs, veterans, police, etc. – achieved significant initial success, but 
Ukrainian government troops then rallied and were able to recover lost territory. At this 
point, in late summer 2014, Russia  became more directly involved, introducing large 
numbers of regular troops. As of mid -October 2016, 6,000 regular Russian troops were 
in eastern Ukraine (excluding Crimea) or along the border with Russia (Jensen, 2017: 4). 
Former militias were replaced by  Russians or incorporated into Russian units (Jensen, 
2017).  The July 2014 shooting down of a Malaysian airliner by pro -Russian forces in the 
Donbas could also have influenced the Kremlin’s shift towards more direct and overt 
Russian involvement in the conflict (Jensen, 2017).   
As explained in Section 2, the economy of the Donbas has been badly hit by conflict and 
sanctions which prevent trade with both government -controlled areas of Ukraine, and 
Russia (some trade and ‘laundering’ of exports through Russia  does take place). Russian 
subsidies and support fill some of the gap, but since 2014 the dependence on organised 
crime has increased:  
Illegal production and smuggling of coal is widespread, sometimes involving 
officials on the Russian side of the border. Other smuggling includes trafficking 
in scrap metal, drugs, consumer goods and weapons…A decrease in Kremlin"|input/report2.pdf|19|2adeef42e0424a7dac46af78bb309631
"in scrap metal, drugs, consumer goods and weapons…A decrease in Kremlin 
financial support for the separatist fighters (in 2017) due to Russia’s economic 
problems has led to an increase of official corruption in Luhansk and Donetsk, 
according to Ukrainian official sources (Jensen, 2017: 10).  
In the CADLR smuggling increased massively after Kiev imposed an economic blockade, 
banning trade with the area: the black market that filled the gap covered a host of items 
including  food products, electronics, weapons, narcotics, etc. and there was even 
evidence of selling of humanitarian aid (ICG, 2020; Jensen, 2017). The DPR and LPR have 
effectively become ‘bandit kingdoms’, dependent on criminal activities. Moscow has 
been unwilli ng or unable to combat the corruption flourishing in the Donbas (Jensen, 
2017: 10).  
As in Crimea, there is cooperation between Ukrainian and Russian OCGs in the Donbas 
region."|input/report2.pdf|19|88594a5abe994640b563379b0b5567bf
"Corruption, crime and conflict in eastern Ukraine  
21 5. Links between organised crime 
and oligarchs  
In both Crimea and the Donbas r egion, power rests in the hands of oligarchs who have 
close ties to organised crime. In the case of Crimea, the annexation of the peninsula by 
Russia gave such people even more power. As seen, Sergei Aksyonov, official head of 
Russian Crimea, was associate d with the Salem criminal gang. He is closely tied to the 
Crimean parliament speaker Vladimir Konstantinov, ‘perhaps the pivotal powerbroker 
on the peninsula… (He) has also been persistently linked with organized crime 
connections and allegations of constr uction and real estate fraud’ (Galoetti, 2014b).  
Crimea’s criminal and political elites have had new opportunities for enrichment since 
the peninsula became part of Russia. One is through simple expropriation. All properties 
belonging to Ihor Kolomoyskiy, once Ukraine’s fourth -richest man and a supporter of 
Ukraine, were seized under the orders of the Crimean State Council. The proceeds from 
their auction were supposed to be used to support the regional budget, but Galeotti 
(2014b) claims the assets would h ave been transferred into the hands of cronies and 
agents for the least price, or the funds raised would have been embezzled. Kiev accused 
the Crimean government of illegally seizing some 80,000 hectares of land and properties 
worth USD 110 million, ‘much of which already appears to have made its way into"|input/report2.pdf|20|1c32ee184f0041279a9e7fa7565a1226
"worth USD 110 million, ‘much of which already appears to have made its way into 
private hands’.  
A second is by applying state pressure on rival Tatar OCGs in Crimea. Galeotti (2014b) 
claims that part of the ‘deal’ brokered by Russian security forces between Crimean 
political elites an d local organised criminal groups was ‘a promise for not only continued 
opportunities for enrichment but also support against the non -Slavic gangs who had 
begun to encroach onto their turfs, especially Tatars and North Caucasians’. Since 
Crimea’s annexatio n, police and Russia’s Federal Security Force (FSB) have been 
cracking down on Tatar organisations, as well as legal and illegal businesses controlled 
by non -Slavic gangs. While Tatar groups have been more heavily targeted, other non -
Slavic groups have bee n significantly constrained: ‘Chechens, for example, have been 
forced to relax their previously tight grip on the local drug trade and instead hand a 
share over to the Slavic gangs’ (Galeotti, 2014b).  
A third is through embezzlement of funds pumped into Cr imea by Moscow for large -
scale infrastructure projects – these ‘represent honeypots for the gangsters’ (Galeotti, 
2014b). In addition, Putin added Crimea to the list of areas allowed to run gambling 
ventures: organised gambling was outlawed across Russia i n 2009 as ‘a dangerous 
addiction and a magnet for organized crime’, but a few locations were allowed to build"|input/report2.pdf|20|cd0a118abdf843859679861b712806a4
"addiction and a magnet for organized crime’, but a few locations were allowed to build 
and run casino complexes, especially with an eye to overseas markets (Galeotti, 2014b). 
Adding Crimea to the list would potentially bring in milli ons of dollars a year for the 
overstretched regional budget, but Galeotti (2014b) predicts ‘it is unlikely that anything 
of the sort will actually end up in the public purse’. He notes that casinos have long been 
associated with organised crime; prime loca tions for loan sharking, money laundering, 
vice of every kind, and protection racketeering."|input/report2.pdf|20|103b7d1bce83484085778b7d566dca18
"Corruption, crime and conflict in eastern Ukraine  
22 Galeotti (2014b) sums up the links between organised criminal groups, oligarchs and 
Russia:  
(T)he gangs with political connections gain protection and privileged ac cess 
to upperworld and underworld resources. In return, they kick back payments 
but also provide political support to their allies, in a self -sustaining loop. This 
is, after all, the essence of the Russian political system in a nutshell. The 
Kremlin reward s those who demonstrate utility and loyalty, and at the same 
time expects and demands that they continue to demonstrate those qualities. 
In the short term, this is a brutally effective means of creating an elite base 
and maintaining control over it: when e veryone is compromised, everyone is 
vulnerable, and everyone needs regularly to demonstrate their commitment 
to the boss.   
A similar pattern of political and criminal elites benefiting from opportunities offered by 
the separation from Ukraine has been seen in the Donbas. The ‘nationalisation’ of key 
factories and other businesses in the region, entailed political elites exprop riating firms, 
extorting money and using their authority to enrich themselves. Jensen (2017: 10) 
writes that Donbas regional business oligarchs, sometimes with commercial ties to both 
sides, have been active in the struggle for resources and political powe r. He also 
describes how pro -Russia Ukrainian politicians and business oligarchs provide money"|input/report2.pdf|21|687c338a5f504f488307cf1fae2dcf8e
"describes how pro -Russia Ukrainian politicians and business oligarchs provide money 
and economic leverage. For example (Jensen, 2017: 8):  
 Business mogul Viktor Medvedchuk, widely seen as one of the key Ukrainian 
oligarchs supporting Putin, served as intermediary between Kiev and Kremlin 
appointees in the Donbas and has been accused by Ukrainian officials of financing 
the extremist groups that organized the violent uprising in eastern Ukra ine. 
 Oligarch Oleksandr Onyshchenko, long a business p artner of departed President 
Yanukovych and himself accused by Ukrainian officials of embezzlement of state 
property, has advanced Kremlin interests by accusing the Poroshenko government of 
corrupti on. 
5.1. Impact on transnational crime  
The annexation of Crime a by Russia, and the ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine has led 
to a rise in transnational crime in the region. Galeotti (2014a) notes that the country is 
an ideal hub for the global underworld because it has all the resources and facilities of a 
modern, industrial nation, e.g. ports and banks, but not the capacity to secure and 
control them: ‘This kind of potential black hole is a priceless asset for the world’s 
gangsters’. In the immediate aftermath of Russia annexing Crimea and the insurgency 
beginning in the Donbas region, Galeotti (2014a  and 2014b ) identified a number of ways 
in which the situation is/could impact global crime:"|input/report2.pdf|21|f0ba85ca1bd44a7f9f34ec5213f657ed
"beginning in the Donbas region, Galeotti (2014a  and 2014b ) identified a number of ways 
in which the situation is/could impact global crime:  
 Rise in organised crime in rest of Ukraine  – Various forms, including protection 
racketeering, drug sales, and using fake docu ments and corrupt officials to steal 
property, are on the rise."|input/report2.pdf|21|a06d965acff745e283a3d5f3cc8d3dc3
"Corruption, crime and conflict  in eastern Ukraine  
23  Rise in smuggling into Europe  – Preliminary reports from European police and 
customs bodies indicate an increase. This entails not only Ukrainian goods, but also 
cocaine from Latin America and Afghanistan, and even stolen cars from Scandinavia 
– re-exported through Ukraine into Greece and the Balkans. Illicit goods are also 
being moved eastward into Russia.  
 Smuggling hub shift from Odessa to Sevastopol – Until 2014, Odesa handled the 
lion's share of not just Ukrainian but also Russian smuggling over the Black Sea. 
However, it could be displaced by Sevastopol, which offers a number of advantages, 
including that  the Russian Black Sea Fleet is based there, and military supply 
convoys —which are exempt from regular police and customs checks —are a cheap 
and secure way to transport illicit goods. In addition, there are close links between 
organised crime groups and local political leaders in Crimea. Hence, if OCGs in 
Sevastopol can  establish reliable shipping routes and can match/undercut Odessa’s 
rates, this could lead to a major realignment of regional smuggling. Even the 
possibility of this has been enough to force Odessa to reduce charges on illicit goods 
trafficked through the port.   
 Rise in money laundering through Ukraine  - Ukraine's financial sector is 
notoriously under -regulated . To date, other countries, notably Cyprus, Latvia and"|input/report2.pdf|22|406049baddbb4f05a0b1f46e58159027
"notoriously under -regulated . To date, other countries, notably Cyprus, Latvia and 
Israel, have attracted international flows because of their greater efficiency, but 
those coun tries are now curbing illicit financial flows under international pressure. 
The combination of this, and Ukraine’s need for business and strong links to Russia, 
could lead to the country – and notably Crimea – becoming a hub for illicit 
international finan cial flows.  
 Spread of OCG members to other European countries  – If Kiev is finally able to 
defeat the rebellion in the east, it is unlikely that Russia will want to take in former 
insurgents. These could instead move to other parts of Europe and North Ame rica, 
and undertake criminal activities there.  
Hubanova et al (2020) note that the potential for increased transnational crime offered 
by the conflict, is accompanied by a deterioration in cross -border cooperation to combat 
crime. OCCRP reported in Octobe r 2018 (cited in Home Office, 2019: 21) that sales of 
illegal weapons had doubled in Ukraine in the past year. The USSD BINLEA March 2019 
report  (cited in Home Office, 2019: 17 ) noted the Russian aggression in eastern Ukraine 
had ‘created a new vulnerabili ty for drug transit through the region ’.  
The conflict has also led to the spread of criminality to Russia, notably Rostov Oblast just

activity in southern Russia – criminal cases rose from 5,000 in 2013 to 8,000 in 2015 
(Jensen, 2017: 11). Jensen ( 2017) also notes that Rostov is a gateway to the rest of the

24 6. Conclusion  
Corruption and crime are clearly linked in Ukraine, including in Crimea and the Donbas 
region. Evidence suggests that OCGs and political elites/oligarchs are joined in symbiotic 
partnerships. The 2014 annexation of Crimea by Russia, and the ongoing conflict in 
eastern Ukraine , was also strongly linked to both. Factors like poor governance , related 
to corruption and criminality , led to the Donbas conflict , and organised criminal groups 
were involved in the fighting. Moreover, the conflict has exacerbated both organised 
crime and corruption in Crimea and Donbas, as well as leading to a rise in transnational 
crime. The highly intermeshed nature of corruption, crime and conflict in eastern 
Ukraine me ans that  not only is finding solutions difficult, but the situation with regard to 
each is getting worse."|input/report2.pdf|23|e01232c10e60444d9949aec47bf98a6d
