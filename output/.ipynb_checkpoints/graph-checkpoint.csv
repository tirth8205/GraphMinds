The ICG reported in 2017 that Ukrainian amber began to attract the interest of organized crime in the 1990s; strong protection rackets reportedly overseen by figures close to the government emerged in the 2000s, when a rise in the global price of amber stimulated illicit mining.|4bf3776b50e74d62b2eaf01d25029459|

health spas|holiday resorts'|Both health spas and holiday resorts are found in Crimea, which has seen an increase in organized crime activity post-independence. In particular, Simferopol has been fought over by rival gangs, the Bashmaki and Salem, who act as both entrepreneurs and predators, forcing local businesses to pay tribute and sell their goods (Galeotti, 2014b). This has facilitated the dominance of these gangsters-turned-businessmen in Crimea, as Kiev has shown little interest in promoting good governance and economic prosperity in the region.|d0e9b4ce2af64343905bbd4a60974cdb|

corruption|organized criminals|in eastern Ukraine, corruption and organized crime have free reign and are given legitimacy. These criminal groups target control of businesses and land in places like Bashmaki leaders trying to take over Crimea's main soccer club, SC Tavria Simferopol, primarily for the properties it owns (Galeotti, 2014b).|d10508bfc60840d49da6cffcf7774601|
organized criminals|local government and politics|In Crimea, organized criminal groups have moved into both above-board businesses and local government and politics. According to a former prosecutor in the region, 'every government level of Crimea was criminalized' (Viktor Shemchuk, cited in Galeotti, 2014b).|d10508bfc60840d49da6cffcf7774601|
crimea|russian connection to criminalization|Although Crimea was a part of Ukraine, many of the most lucrative criminal businesses, such as trafficking narcotics and counterfeit or untaxed cigarettes, depended on relationships with Russian criminal networks.

rule of law|donbas|Before the Soviet collapse, the concept of 'rule of law' was rare in Donbas according to Kosicki and Nesterenko (2014).

crimean annexation|connection between crime and the russian state|Galeotti (2014b) comments: what the Crimean annexation has demonstrated in especially stark form is the connection between crime and the Russian state that is not essentially parasitic and competitive (as it is when criminals embezzle e the federal budget) but instead complementary and symbiotic. Indeed, Crimea is a case study both of the way that the Kremlin uses criminals as instruments of state policy and also how the underworld and upperworld have become inextricably entwined as a consequence.|df4c582d23a74c1eba63d1fb205479fa|

donbas|ukraine's gangsters|The emergence of separatist movements in the Donbas can be attributed to the weak governance and strong links to organized crime in Ukraine, as noted by Kosicki and Nesterenko (2014). The sense of frustration felt by local people due to neglect by successive Ukrainian governments also contributed to the insurgency in Luhansk and Donetsk (ICG, 2020). Notably, many political and economic leaders from Ukraine's Donbas region, including Yanukovych, Kuchma, Akhmetov, and others, had ties to Yanukovych's Party of Regions and billions of dollars of assets linked to Russia (Darden, 2014).|3309864b84374ae7a3969840baa6be66|
donbas|russia-based insurgency|The emergence of separatist movements in the Donbas also coincided with Russia's annexation of Crimea and can be interpreted as a perverse form of cooperation between Ukraine's gangsters and their Russian counterparts, as noted (anonymous, 2014).|3309864b84374ae7a3969840baa6be66|
